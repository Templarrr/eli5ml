The most frequently used (and often confused and misused) terms are Data Science (DS), Machine Learning (ML) and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here is how I define them (you will find a lot of different definition around the net).

**Data Science** is a science about the data. Lol. Think of it as an extension of mathematics (and more specifically - 
statistics). Science does not disappear if you don't have computer, it's still as applicable when done with pen and 
paper or in your mind. Theoretical foundation for everything else. A lot of scientists belong here.

**Machine Learning** is a set of technics implementing Data Science ideas using computers.
You can be genius but if you need to solve 2 million equations you're not doing it manually.
This part is where engineers take over.

**Artificial Intelligence** is a final result. And it is not a SkyNet (yet!). You take your data, your (Data) scientists
analyze it using tools provided by your (ML) engineers, find the ways to produce the results (whatever those results
were) and then give those back to engineers to make an actual system - usually software application - to use.
These final results are your [Dall-E2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) to create beautiful pictures, and 
[AlphaZero](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go) to beat everyone in chess 
but most of these are actually much less interesting but more impactful "how many tomatoes my store need to prepare
for next month to maximize profit and minimize losses" and similar. And if you are looking for SkyNet - you need
to search for **Artificial General Intelligence** and prepare to be disappointed - we don't actually know how to
do THAT kind of AI. Maybe for the best :)
