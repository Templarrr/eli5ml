# Machine learning concepts in ELI5 form

[EN](README.md) | [UA](README_ua.md) | [RU](README_ru.md)

Hi there! No idea why are you reading this, but if anything on this page helps you - I'm glad.
Making the world a better place consists of many small changes and I hope this will eventually become one.

I'm [Mykhailo Odintsov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihailodintsov/), and you're reading my notes on Machine Learning concepts that
I've learned myself working in amazing [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com) company and trying to record in extremely
simplified way as an introduction to the world of ML.

This page is in equal parts
* Notes for future reference for myself and others. 
* Long form writing training. I'm a software engineer, not an author, after all!
* Language training. I'm from Ukraine and this allows me to train writing in other languages - it's almost guaranteed 
  I'll make a lot of mistakes!
* Markdown training. Open formats readable in any way rocks!
* Just a fun experiment!

ELI5 form means "explain like I'm 5". So a lot of things here will be oversimplified, but at the same time should
be pretty easy to consume for anyone slightly interested.
