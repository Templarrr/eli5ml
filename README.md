# Machine learning concepts in ELI5 form

[EN](README.md) | [UA](README_ua.md) | [RU](README_ru.md)

WORK IN PROGRESS.

Hi there! No idea why are you reading this, but if anything on this page helps you - I'm glad.
Making the world a better place consists of many small changes and I hope this will eventually become one.

I'm [Mykhailo Odintsov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihailodintsov/), and you're reading my notes on Machine Learning concepts that
I've learned myself working in amazing [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com) company and trying to record in extremely
simplified way as an introduction to the world of ML.

This page is in equal parts
* Notes for future reference for myself and others. 
* Long form writing training. I'm a software engineer, not an author, after all!
* Language training. I'm from Ukraine and this allows me to train writing in other languages - it's almost guaranteed 
  I'll make a lot of mistakes!
* Markdown training. Open formats readable in any way rocks!
* Just a fun experiment!

ELI5 form means "explain like I'm 5". So a lot of things here will be oversimplified, but at the same time should
be pretty easy to consume for anyone slightly interested.

Planned contents (look how all these slowly become replaced with links when implemented!)
1. [Basic definitions](definitions.md).
2. Machine Learning project types.
3. Fantastic data and what to do with it (or how to convert everything to numbers).
4. ML model types.
5. Tricks and metrics to measure how good your results are.
6. Insights and other explainability tools.
